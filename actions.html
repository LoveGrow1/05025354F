        <h4>Develop a 'no-judgement' communication zone:</h4>

        <h4>Make emotional support more overt:</h4>
        <p>Given the demands of parenting and a relationship of 15 years, it's important to show appreciation for each other's support, especially during difficult times. Explicitly acknowledge his efforts and ask how he would prefer to be supported when he's upset. Demonstrating this in front of your kids can also be a wonderful example of emotional intelligence.</p>
